Deeploy Helper for Expression Engine
===================================

Deeploy Helper is a simple module to make our lives as EE developers just a little easier. It collects many of the configuration parameters we most frequently modify on one page, where power users can modify them all at once.  Are you an EE developer who wouldn’t mind a few extra minutes in your day?  Maybe Deeploy Helper can help!

Deeploy Helper is compatible with EE 2.8+. It probably also works with 2.7 all the way back down to EE 2.1—but we haven’t retro-tested it. If you want any earlier version, including versions for EE 1.x, just get in touch!

**Please note: This is a very powerful tool.** It works in our tests, and it’s worked for many other EE developers who have downloaded it. But because it directly updates system settings tables in your EE database, this tool has the potential to damage your installation.  We encourage its use on well-backed-up systems.

**EE 3 Special File Upload Preferences** File Upload Preferences (Default Avatars), File Upload Preferences (Member Photos) and File Upload Preferences (Signature Attachments) are not changeable directly in EE. However, we want to offer you the possibility to change them if ever needed but please be careful when changing those.

If you want to use it, [please buy it](https://devot-ee.com/add-ons/deeploy-helper). :)
