# Deploy Helper

Deeploy Helper is a simple module to make our lives as EE developers just a little easier. It collects many of the configuration parameters we most frequently modify on one page, where power users can modify them all at once.  Are you an EE developer who wouldn’t mind a few extra minutes in your day?  Maybe Deeploy Helper can help!

**Please note: This is a very powerful tool.** It works in our tests, and it’s worked for many other EE developers who have downloaded it. But because it directly updates system settings tables in your EE database, this tool has the potential to damage your installation.  We encourage its use on well-backed-up systems.

## Usage

After installing Deeploy Helper, navigate to its page from the “Modules” tab.  You’ll see a long list of configuration parameters, many of which you can modify.  Click “Update Settings” after making changes.

**Note:**

- Deeploy Helper is a very sharp tool.  It works in our tests, and it’s worked for many other EE developers who have downloaded it.  But because it directly updates system settings tables in your EE database, this tool has the potential to damage your installation.  You should only use it if you know why you’re using it, and you should ALWAYS backup your system before you use it.

- The current version of Deeploy Helper does not test the validity of input parameters.  For example, it does not verify that filesystem paths exist and are writeable.  You did read the bullet point above, right?
